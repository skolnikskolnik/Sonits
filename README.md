Generating user interface

1. Create a popup that asks the user for how long the password length should be, then convert it into a number

2. Validate that length is between 8 and 128

3. Added series of pop up questions and redirects for invalid responses

Now to generate a password for the user

4. Made a function to make random letters (started with all lower case)
    Adopted function from: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generate-random-alpha-numeric-string-in-javascript/
