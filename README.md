Generating user interface

1. Create a popup that asks the user for how long the password length should be, then convert it into a number

2. Validate that length is between 8 and 128

3. Added series of pop up questions and redirects for invalid responses

Now to generate a password for the user

4. Made a function to make random letters (started with all lower case)
    Adopted function from: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generate-random-alpha-numeric-string-in-javascript/

5. Making a variable to add together the strings that the person chose to add together to be applied to the function from #4

6. The javascript generates a password, stored as a string called genPasswd

7. Removed the parameters from the function definition as they will not change while the page is active

8. Combined the function that I made in 4 with that given from the repo such that it would print to the screen and not just the console log 

9. Removed repetitive portions
